# TODO

0. (**IN PROGRESS**) Remove all space indenting like in `build_eqaulity.dart`. Also remove all files with `_override` suffix;
1. refactor: Remove `Element`/`ClassElement` usage when `source_gen` fixes the deprecation;
2. (**IN PROGRESS**) Tests (with 100% code coverage);
3. Make a repo for common Bash scripts in Dart, create a fix and formatter script, then call it here (set 120 line length);
4. CI/CD;
5. Publish to <https://pub.dev>.
